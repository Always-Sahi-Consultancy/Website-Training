    <h1>Importance of Water</h1>
    <p><b>Water(H<sub>2</sub>O)</b> is very important to the human body. Every one of your cells,
    organs and tissues use water to help with temperature regulation, keeping 
    hydrated and maintaining bodily functions. In addition, water acts as a 
    lubricant and cushions your joints. Drinking water is great for your overall health. 
    According to the <strong>CDC</strong> <ins>Center for Disease Control</ins> everyone should drink water daily.</p>
    <p><b>Water and Your Heart Health:</b> Drinking water is very good for your heart. 
        Your heart is working continually to pump 2,000 gallons i.e 2 * 10<sup>3</sup>  of blood throughout 
        your body a day. By drinking water and keeping hydrated, you are helping your 
        heart do its job. Your heart Is able to pump blood more easily when hydrated 
        (consuming more water than you are losing) and allows the rest of the muscles 
        in your body to work much better.</p>
    <p><mark><b>FUN FACT:</b></mark>  <i>IF YOU ARE THIRSTY, YOU ARE ALREADY DEHYDRATED.</i></p>
    <p><b>Water and Weight Loss:</b> Water naturally has zero calories, therefore, 
        substituting water for soda or juice can reduce your caloric intake. 
        Switching out one 20 oz. <del>sugary</del> Sugary beverage for water reduces your caloric 
        intake by <small>240</small> calories.</p>
    <p>There are no recommended standards for how much plain water one should 
        drink daily because intake varies based on age, sex, weight, and many 
        other factors. It is recommended for an adult male over the age of 19 
        to consume 3.7 liters of water per day. An adult non-lactating female 
        over the age of 19 is recommended to consume 2.7 liters of water per day. 
        Females that are pregnant or lactating are recommended to consume 3-3.8 liters 
        of water per day. These values include the water you get from food and other 
        (non-water) beverages throughout your day.</p>
    <p><b>Hydration:</b> Drinking water keeps you from becoming dehydrated; a condition 
        that can cause confusion, mood change, overheating, constipation, and other 
        symptoms. The CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends, to decrease your 
        risk of becoming dehydrated, that you have a drink with every meal, and drink 
        whenever you are thirsty. An easy way to determine if you have had enough water 
        is to check your urine. <em>If it’s a darker yellow, you need more water. If it’s a 
        pale yellow or clear you’re doing great.</em></p>
